AI App Generator 🧠🚀
An AI-powered application generator that creates frontend React.js code and machine learning scripts based on user input. Built with Streamlit and Llama 2 (Ollama) for local AI processing.

📌 Features
✅ Frontend Code Generation – Creates React.js apps dynamically.
✅ Machine Learning Code Generation – Generates Python ML scripts using scikit-learn.
✅ Local AI Model Processing – Uses Llama 2 with Ollama for fast, offline AI responses.
✅ Easy-to-Use UI – Powered by Streamlit for simple interaction.

🛠 Installation
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Run the following command:
